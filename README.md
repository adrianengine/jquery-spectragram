On June 1, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, [will stop allowing many third parties to access the images in its feeds](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/just-instagram/).

This means you will no longer be able to fetch photos form other users with spectragram after May 31.

# How to use

In order to use the plugin you need to register an application at [Instagram Developers](http://instagram.com/developer/), get a **client_id** and [recieve an access_token](http://instagram.com/developer/authentication/).

### Simple usage

1. Be sure to have jQuery script included and then include the **spectragram.js** script right before the ``` </body>``` tag.

``` html
 <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="js/spectragram.js"></script>
```

1. Set your Instagram ```accessToken```, ```clientID``` and the query:

``` javascript
jQuery.fn.spectragram.accessData = {
	accessToken: 'your-instagram-access-token',
	clientID: 'your-instagram-application-clientID'
};
```

1. Call **spectagram** function on the container element and pass it your query:

``` javascript
$('ul').spectragram('getRecentTagged',{
