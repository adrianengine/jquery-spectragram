# Platform Changees

On June 1 2015, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, [will stop allowing many third parties to access the images in its feeds](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/just-instagram/).

This means you will no longer be able to fetch photos form other users with spectragram after May 31.

Please follow this instructions to make it work with your own sandboxed feed:
[How to get Instagram API access token and fix your broken feed](https://github.com/adrianengine/jquery-spectragram/wiki/How-to-get-Instagram-API-access-token-and-fix-your-broken-feed)

On April 4 2018, some endpoints this plugin use were deprecated:
[Instagram Platform Changelog](https://www.instagram.com/developer/changelog/)

**Please upgrade** in order to make your Instagram feed work again.

# Features

* Get the most recent or recently tagged media published by your user from Instagram API
* Display the results on list items or any other HTML tag you define
* Define the size of the pictures (small, medium, big)

# How to use

In order to use the plugin you need to register an application at [Instagram Developers](http://instagram.com/developer/), and [recieve an access_token](http://instagram.com/developer/authentication/).

### Simple usage

1. Be sure to have jQuery script included and then include the **spectragram.min.js** script right before the ``` </body>``` tag.

``` html

 <script type="text/javascript" src="js/spectragram.min.js"></script>
```

1. Set your Instagram ```accessToken``` and the query (username or tag):

``` javascript
jQuery.fn.spectragram.accessData = {
	accessToken: 'your-instagram-access-token'
};
```

1. Call **spectagram** function on the container element and pass it your query:

``` javascript
$('ul').spectragram('getUserFeed', {
	size: 'big'
});
