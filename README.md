# Instagram Platform Changes

- On June 1 2015, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, [will stop allowing many third parties to access the images in its feeds](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/just-instagram/).

- This means you will no longer be able to fetch photos form other users with spectragram after May 31.

- ~~Please follow this instructions to make it work with your own sandboxed feed:
[How to get Instagram API access token and fix your broken feed](https://github.com/adrianengine/jquery-spectragram/wiki/How-to-get-Instagram-API-access-token-and-fix-your-broken-feed)~~ **Update:** Not longer valid.

- On April 4 2018, some endpoints this plugin use were deprecated:
[Instagram Platform Changelog](https://www.instagram.com/developer/changelog/)

- Instagram Legacy API Will be disabled. [Facebook announced the API will work until March 31, 2020.](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/03/10/final-reminder-Instagram-legacy-api-platform-disabled-mar-31/) **Update** will be deprecated on June 29, 2020.

- Spectragram.js has been updated to use the new Instagram Basic Display API, please follow the [new Token process](https://github.com/adrianengine/jquery-spectragram/wiki/Register-on-Instagram-Basic-Display-API-and-get-an-Access-Token).

# Plugin Simple Usage

1. Be sure to have jQuery script included and then include the **spectragram.min.js** script right before the ``` </body>``` tag.

``` html
 <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="js/spectragram.min.js"></script>
```

1. Set your Instagram ```accessToken```:

``` javascript
jQuery.fn.spectragram.accessData = {
	accessToken: 'your-instagram-access-token'
};
```

1. Call **spectagram** function on the container element and pass it your custom options:

``` javascript
$('ul').spectragram({
	size: 'small'
});
